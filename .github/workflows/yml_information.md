steps: defines the individual steps in the workflow.
Checkout code: checks out the repository code.
Setup Node.js: sets up the Node.js environment with the specified version.
Install dependencies: installs the dependencies using npm install.

NOTE:
Hostinger does offer a CI/CD platform, but it's not as well-known as some of the other options like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

Hostinger's CI/CD platform is called "Hostinger CI/CD" or "Hostinger Auto Deploy", and it's a part of their web hosting services. It allows users to automate their deployment process, including building, testing, and deploying their applications.

Hostinger CI/CD supports various programming languages, including Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, and integrates with popular version control systems like Git.

Some of the features of Hostinger CI/CD include:

Automated deployments: Hostinger CI/CD can automatically deploy your application to your production environment after each code push.
Build and test: Hostinger CI/CD can build and test your application, including running automated tests and checking for errors.
Environment variables: Hostinger CI/CD allows you to set environment variables for your application, making it easy to manage different environments.
Custom scripts: Hostinger CI/CD allows you to run custom scripts during the deployment process, giving you more control over the deployment process.
However, Hostinger CI/CD has some limitations compared to other CI/CD platforms, such as:

Limited customization: Hostinger CI/CD has limited customization options, which may not be suitable for complex deployment workflows.
Limited integration: Hostinger CI/CD may not integrate with as many third-party services as other CI/CD platforms.
Limited scalability: Hostinger CI/CD may not be suitable for large-scale applications or high-traffic websites.
If you're already using Hostinger for your web hosting needs, their CI/CD platform might be a convenient option for automating your deployment process. However, if you're looking for a more robust and customizable CI/CD solution, you may want to consider other options like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.
